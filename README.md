- Get the weather no matter where I am (geolocate users, and create a new Feelio API) [#4](https://github.com/marineb/feelio-ios-app/issues/4) [#5](https://github.com/marineb/feelio-ios-app/issues/5)
- Smarter "now" algorithm that takes into account the rest of the day / night [#6](https://github.com/marineb/feelio-ios-app/issues/6)
- Get app notifications when I wake up or when I go to bed [#7](https://github.com/marineb/feelio-ios-app/issues/7)
- I want an algorithm that is personalized to me
- I want 3 themes:
  - Dark
  - Light
  - A theme that changes depending on day/night and the weather
- If it’s the evening, don’t give me upcoming hourly (like 4am) but just the weather for tomorrow. And if I’ll need an umbrella.
- A way to switch from °F to °C
