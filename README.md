- Get app notifications when I wake up or when I go to bed [#7](https://github.com/marineb/feelio-ios-app/issues/7)

  - Dark
  - Light
  - A theme that changes depending on day/night and the weather
- I want an algorithm that is personalized to me and my sensitivity to weather
- If it’s the evening, don’t give me upcoming hourly (like 4am) but just the weather for tomorrow. And if I’ll need an umbrella.
- A way to switch from °F to °C
